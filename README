Implementation of an hypothetical RISC processor.

Includes:
- Symbolic assembler for easy target code generation.
- Emulator which emulates whole CPU and machine.
- Extendable IO interfaces




Quick start
-----------


First you need an application. There's some tests available, for example:

$ cat tests/test.asm
[ output of test.asm ]

Next you need to make binary from that symbolic assembly code:

$ ./assembler.py tests/test.asm test.bin

This should generate test.bin, which is ready to run binary.

$ ./runner.py test.bin

Will run the binary and output some debug data.
